# The Oak processionary caterpillar: a Threat to Oak (Quercus) trees
The [oak processionary caterpillar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_processionary),
or Eikenprocessierups in Dutch, is a pest that causes significant damage to oak
trees in Europe. The caterpillar's hairs contain a toxic protein called
`thaumetopoein` that can cause skin irritation, respiratory problems, and
anaphylactic shock in some individuals. The species is most prevalent in the
Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, where it poses a significant health hazard.

Oak trees are an essential part of many ecosystems and have significant cultural
and historical value. The genus `Quercus` is home to over 500 species of trees
and shrubs, and their conservation is crucial for biodiversity and the
environment.
