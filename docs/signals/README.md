# Signalen
Signalen is a web-based application designed to enable citizens and interested
parties to report issues related to public spaces, for example complaints
related to the oak processionary caterpillar, to the relevant municipal 
services.

The application allows users to submit their complaints, which are then
processed by the appropriate municipal services. In this case, the municipal
service responsible for handling such complaints utilizes GISIB to manage and
address them effectively.

# API and Front-end Code
The API code for Signalen can be accessed through the GitHub repository located
at [Amsterdam/signals](https://github.com/Amsterdam/signals), while the
associated web front-end code can be found at 
[Amsterdam/signals-frontend](https://github.com/Amsterdam/signals-frontend).
