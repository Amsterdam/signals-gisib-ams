# Feature Collection
A Feature Collection is a JSON object that contains an array of features, where
each feature is a JSON object with a geometry and a set of properties. A feature
represents a spatially bounded entity, such as a point, line, or polygon, and
its associated attributes. A Feature Collection can represent any number of
features, and the features can be of different types.

A Feature Collection is often used to represent geographic data, and it is a
common format used by web mapping libraries and services. For example, the
OpenLayers library uses Feature Collections to represent vector data on a map.
Feature Collections can be easily consumed and rendered by web mapping
applications, and they can be easily transformed into other formats, such as
GeoJSON, which is a standard format for geographic data in web mapping.

For more information on GeoJSON and Feature Collections, see the
