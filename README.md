# Welcome to the "signals-gisib-ams" GitHub project!

The "signals-gisib-ams" GitHub project is a tool that facilitates communication
between the RESTful Signals API and GISIB (Geographic Information System) for
the City of Amsterdam.

## Summary

In short, when you report a complaint through the Signals system, it will be 
picked up and will be sent over to GISIB for them to deal with. This project
will keep track of the complaints send to GISIB and when handled it will update
the status in the Signals API.

## Oak processionary caterpillar
The [Oak processionary caterpillar](./docs/oak_processionary_caterpillar.md)
(Eikenprocessierups in Ducth) is a pest that causes significant damage to oak
trees in Europe. Its toxic hairs can cause health problems for humans and
animals. Oak trees are important for biodiversity and have cultural and
historical value.
